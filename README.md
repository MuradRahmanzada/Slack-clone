# Slack Clone

### Description
- Slack-Clone is a clone of a slack. Implemented using React and Firebase.
- Behind the backend, I was used React-Firebase for authentication with Google-auth, and highly secure specially for non-authorized users. 
- And I have developed a channel section to add new channels and communicate through these channels.
- I have used firestore to keep store all the messages spread among the channels or community. 
- And ofcourse our database will be safe under google-firebase security so no worries about securities.

### Features
- The channels or messages are stored in firestore database so quickly accessible via our app.
- I was used react-router-dom for saving server-side loads or refreshing. this functionality improve the speed for redirect to one component to another without refreshing from  server-side it makes life easier, save lots of time and fast to switch without loading or refreshing the whole page.
- Our data will be in real-time, if any changes make happens in messages or channels then it will automatically changes in our app in real-time no need to refresh our page.
the app will be responsive like if you used in Desktop or Mobile devices it render same thing.



### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
<a href="https://slack-clone01.netlify.app/">Demo</a>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
